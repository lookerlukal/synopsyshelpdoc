<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">The previous sections in this chapter have explained how to set up the data files for optimization, and they all assume that you start with a lens that has good possibilities.  </span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">But sometimes you do not have one. &nbsp;There are four features that can help in such cases: </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="um153.htm#xsys" class="topiclink">XSYS</a></span><span class="f_mine">,  </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">DSEARCH</span><span class="f_mine">, </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="um1073.htm#zsearch" class="topiclink">ZSEARCH</a></span><span class="f_mine">, and </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="um1017.htm#spb" class="topiclink">SPBUILD</a></span><span class="f_mine">. &nbsp;While XSYS is a very powerful feature, it requires a lens database that requires some effort to set up. &nbsp;DSEARCH and SPBUILD, on the other hand require no advance preparation. &nbsp;Input for both of these features is much the same. &nbsp;SPB is described in </span><span class="f_mine" style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="um1017.htm" class="topiclink">Section 10.17</a></span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">Both of those features may be found in the dialog </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">MDS</span><span class="f_mine">. &nbsp;This section describes the Design Search program.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">Design Search (DSEARCH)</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">We first point out that although DSEARCH is a remarkably fast and effective global search program, one cannot expect that it will produce finished designs, ready to send to the shop, in one operation. &nbsp;It is intended only to create plausible starting points as a first step in a lengthy design process. &nbsp;Then it is up to you to modify the results as necessary in order to meet your requirements. &nbsp;One usually performs several steps before the design is complete, summarized as follows;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">A. &nbsp;Enter the requirements as best you can into the DSEARCH input file. &nbsp;The dialog MDS can get you started, and then you can modify the file it creates as required.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">B. Run the program and examine the results.  </span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">C. If all of the designs depart from your goals significantly, perhaps because the design went in a direction you did not expect, modify the input and go back to step B.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">D. If one or more designs look like a good starting point, evaluate them to see what shortcomings remain.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">E. Modify the merit function created by DSEARCH, changing weights, adding or modifying monitors and rays, and adding targets for mechanical goals if those are violated.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">F. Optimize and anneal. &nbsp;When that process will go no further, use <a href="um1017.htm#aei" class="topiclink">AEI</a> to add an element where it will do the most good.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">G. Try using <a href="um1016.htm#aed" class="topiclink">AED</a>, to see if an element can be removed.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">I. Repeat steps F and G, perhaps several times, as the configuration continues to improve.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">J. When the design becomes reasonable, it is time to add windows, fold mirrors, dummy surfaces for a cold stop or to monitor the image at a field stop, etc.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">K. When all important goals are met, run the real-glass routine <a href="um547.htm#arglass" class="topiclink">ARGLASS</a> or the glass-search routine <a href="um531.htm#gsearch" class="topiclink">GSEARCH</a>. &nbsp;Those will substitute real glass types for the glass models used by DSEARCH. &nbsp;(For IR and UV designs, the glass model is not appropriate and you should specify the materials directly in the DSEARCH input.)</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">L. Continue to optimize and anneal until the design will not improve any more.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">M. If the design is still not good enough, go back to step D and select a different return from DSEARCH. Then repeat the subsequent steps.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">O. Study the design examples in the Online Tutorial section of the SYNOPSYS website. &nbsp;There you will see how a variety of problems are identified and corrected.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">And a final thought: &nbsp;The optimization algorithms in SYNOPSYS are the most powerful in the world, but nothing can change the chaotic nature of the lens design landscape. &nbsp;The default algorithm is PSD III, activated by switch 2. &nbsp;We have run many test cases with this switch both on and off, and when off, the program uses PSD II instead -- and often the results from the two settings are markedly different. &nbsp;We encourage you to try both switch settings when running DSEARCH, and choose the best returns from both. &nbsp;The setting may be selected with the PSD input, described below.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">The Design Search program will search through lens space in order to find an attractive starting point. &nbsp;You give it the desired system parameters and the number of elements you want, along with some target quantities to define the design goals. &nbsp;Then it performs the following steps:</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">1. &nbsp;It constructs a series of candidate lenses, with initial dimensions assigned according to either a binary search scheme or randomly, depending on user input.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">The default option assigns element powers according to the bit in a binary number that is incremented at each cycle. &nbsp;Thus, if you request, say, a four-element lens, the first lens would have all negative elements taken from the binary number (0000). &nbsp;The next try would have one positive element, from the number (0001) and so on.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">If the RANDOM option is selected, the radii, thicknesses, and airspaces are calculated as a random fraction of the input (or default) values of RSTART, THSTART, and ASTART. &nbsp;In either case, elements are given a GLM glass model (for visible spectrum systems) or are assigned one of two entered glass types (for IR systems).</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">2. &nbsp;If the system is FOCAL, the program assigns a UMC solve to the final surface with a value taken from the desired F/number, and assigns a YMT solve to the final airspace. &nbsp;Thus, the power of the last element defined in step 1 is altered. &nbsp;If it is AFOCAL, the target value of the curvature solve is zero, and there is no YMT solve. &nbsp;These steps can be overridden by user input.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">3. &nbsp;The program constructs a PANT file that varies all radii except the last (which has a solve), all thicknesses except the last, and (if the system is not monochromatic and is in the visible) the GLM variable on each element. &nbsp;It also varies the paraxial quantity YP1, unless directed otherwise. &nbsp;This allows the paraxial stop position to vary.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">4. &nbsp;It traces the upper and lower rim rays to check for ray failures, which are common. &nbsp;If any are found, it submits a quick optimization using the ERROR aberration and the previously defined variables. &nbsp;This usually converges immediately, and the rays will then trace. &nbsp;If not, after several tries that case is skipped.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">5. &nbsp;It constructs an AANT file with the requests AEC and ACC to control edge and center thicknesses so the lenses are reasonable. &nbsp;Then it adds the first-order targets that have been requested and a default set of rays at the entered field points. &nbsp;(The default points are at HBAR = 0., 0.75, and 1.0.) &nbsp;If the system is not monochromatic, it also corrects rays in the long and short colors (taken from the CORDER input). &nbsp;These will be colors 1 and 3 if the default wavelengths (CDF) are in effect. &nbsp;It then adds any input you have given in the SPECIAL section (see below) to the merit function.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">6. &nbsp;It runs the optimization program for the requested number of cycles.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">7. &nbsp;It then submits an </span><span class="f_mine" style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="um1012.htm#anneal" class="topiclink">ANNEAL</a></span><span class="f_mine"> run, if requested, which makes small random changes to the lens and reoptimizes, over and over.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">8. When all of the above steps are done, it cycles with the next candidate lens.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">9. &nbsp;If multicore mode is in effect (see </span><span class="f_mine" style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="um546.htm#core" class="topiclink">CORE</a></span><span class="f_mine">), the program assigns the trial cases sequentially to all of the authorized cores. &nbsp;This can greatly speed up the process, and you are encouraged to implement this mode if your PC has that capability. &nbsp;The optimization file created by DSEARCH cannot define any new AI symbols, but it will inherit and honor any symbols previously defined.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">As it performs these steps, the program saves the resulting designs in two ways. &nbsp;The best design seen so far is automatically saved in the requested library location; the first ten designs are saved in files named DSEARCH01.RLE, DSEARCH02.RLE, up to 10. &nbsp;Thereafter, when each case is optimized, the merit function is compared to the worst of the ten, and if better it replaces that file.  </span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">When all of the cycles have finished, the best lens that was found is therefore in the requested library location, and the ten best are in the named files (although not necessarily in numerical order). &nbsp;The program then makes a composite drawing showing all of the lenses in those files. &nbsp;It also creates and opens a MACro with the name DSEARCH_OPT.MAC, which lets you easily continue work on any of the resulting lenses. &nbsp;In the event that any of them look interesting, be sure to </span><span class="f_mine" style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="um372.htm#fetch" class="topiclink">FETCH</a></span><span class="f_mine"> and save them with a unique name, since the files will be overwritten the next time you run DSEARCH. &nbsp;It also creates a MACro DSS.MAC, which gives you an easy way to open and evaluate in PAD all of the saved examples. &nbsp;Just run that MACro, and press the &lt;Enter&gt; key to go on to the next one.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">The command </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">DSEARCH PLOT</span><span class="f_mine"> will show a plot of the most recent results, in numerical order. &nbsp;DSEARCH automatically makes a plot, sorted by quality -- but this feature lets you come back the next day and make a new plot if you want to.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">This feature is intended only for single configuration fixed-focus lenses. &nbsp;Zoom lenses can be designed with </span><span class="f_mine" style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="um1073.htm#zsearch" class="topiclink">ZSEARCH</a></span><span class="f_mine">.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">The optimization portion by default varies the glass model variable on each element, which is only appropriate for systems operating in the visible portion of the spectrum. &nbsp;If your system is outside this region, you must select the materials to use for positive and negative elements with the GLASS… input, described below. &nbsp;In that case, the glass model is not used or varied.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">DSEARCH identifies each of the 10 best lenses as it saves them. &nbsp;A character string is put into the lens identification string ID1 listing the sequence of element powers that created the design (in binary search mode). &nbsp;Note that the </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-style: italic;">resulting</span><span class="f_mine"> powers are often different from the initial set. &nbsp;In the event you want to run only a particular case again, that string tells you how to identify it.</span></p>

<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">The goal of DSEARCH is to provide a very efficient and fast way to find starting points, and it is successful for the most part. &nbsp;But we cannot claim to have solved the global optimization problem completely. &nbsp;DSEARCH embodies the assumption that, starting from the top of the plane-parallel hill, one can go downhill in any direction</span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">,</span><span class="f_mine"> and each direction will arrive at a different local minimum. &nbsp;We humans like to visualize a 3-D landscape with hills and valleys scattered all over. &nbsp;You want to find the deepest valley. &nbsp;If you go down from the top in any direction, you will arrive at a valley, for sure. &nbsp;In the process, you first alter the starting curves so they are no longer flat. &nbsp;But there are an infinite number of combinations of curvatures that you could, in principle, evaluate. &nbsp;That leads to a very lengthy process, which is in fact implemented in some codes but which we would rather avoid. &nbsp;If one evaluates every node in a multidimensional mesh of combinations (which includes thicknesses, spacings, and index values as well as curvatures), one can easily wind up with 200,000 cases or more. &nbsp;Evaluating that mesh can take all weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">Still, our incompletely understood landscape may have valleys that cannot be reached just by sliding down from the top. &nbsp;In that case, the binary search method will not find it and we need something else. &nbsp;For that reason, we have implemented the RANDOM option. &nbsp;Picture the landscape as a plain with lots of depressions, some wide and shallow, a few narrow and deep. &nbsp;You cannot fall into the deep ones unless you are very close to them. &nbsp;If you request a large number of random cases, say 2000 or more, you increase the likelihood of finding those isolated local minima. &nbsp;And if you use the QUICK option, the time required is not excessive. &nbsp;We have run a problem with six elements, 2000 random cases, with QUICK 60 60 specified. &nbsp;An excellent solution came back in just over eight minutes. &nbsp;You might have to request more than this number in some cases, but we doubt you will ever have to wait for an overnight run.</span></p>

<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">Ray Aiming in DSEARCH</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">We have tested the program with wide-angle camera lenses up to about 90 degrees total field of view, with interesting results. &nbsp;But remember, the program normally uses paraxial rules for ray aiming, and wide-angle lenses usually require a real pupil since pupil aberrations are often large. &nbsp;You can try declaring a </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-style: italic;">real</span><span class="f_mine"> paraxial pupil with the SYSTEM input, with the entry APS -1. &nbsp;Or, when the process completes, you can assign a real stop in the vicinity of where the program wanted the stop to go, remove the YP1 variable from the optimization MACro, and reoptimize if you are working with wide-angle lenses.  </span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">For designing very wide-angle lenses,the program needs your help. &nbsp;If the entering beam is more than 90 degrees from the axis, then of course no rays will trace through the almost-flat surfaces, and DSEARCH will find no solutions. &nbsp;But in such cases there is a simple approach that works very well: rough out a front end of one or two negative elements, bent in a way that the wide-angle beam gets through, and use this portion with the USE CURRENT option. &nbsp;Then DSEARCH will add elements following that section and will probably succeed in finding some very good solutions.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">We have had good results in wide-angle designs by specifying a desired surface as a real stop and turning on the </span><span class="f_mine" style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="um264.htm" class="topiclink">CSTOP</a></span><span class="f_mine"> option (both in the SYSTEM section). &nbsp;Be sure to declare the existence of the stop surface in that section as well by including a surface number higher than that one (so the initial system assigns a CAO to the correct surface). &nbsp;Then, in the GOALS section, specify the STOP FIX </span><span class="f_mine" style="text-decoration: underline;">SN</span><span class="f_mine"> directive so the stop always goes on the same surface. &nbsp;Then the program will use the real pupil instead of paraxial. &nbsp;The disadvantage is that the stop then cannot vary. &nbsp;But you can experiment with different locations if you need to see others.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">MACros created by DSEARCH</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">When DSEARCH has finished, it automatically loads the file DSEARCH_OPT.MAC into a new editor window. &nbsp;This file contains the PANT and AANT entries used for optimization by DSEARCH. &nbsp; Run this file to optimize again, and then try some annealing of your own. &nbsp;Feel free to explore any of the results of DSEARCH, not just the top one. &nbsp;They are not yet optimum, just interesting candidates for further work. &nbsp;And by all means run the program several times, either with the same or slightly different parameters. &nbsp;There will be differences in the output, and you are then better able to judge whether you have found all the best candidates.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">We finish this section with one more topic. &nbsp;You’ve run DSEARCH, and now you want to examine each of the candidate lenses more closely. &nbsp;The program makes a MACro called </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">DSS.MAC</span><span class="f_mine">, which will open each of the resulting lens files and display then in PAD. &nbsp;Here is an example for the case when KEEP 5 was requested:</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">FETCH DSEARCH01</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine"> PAD/U</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine"> NEW</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">FETCH DSEARCH02</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine"> PAD/U</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine"> NEW</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">FETCH DSEARCH03</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine"> PAD/U</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine"> NEW</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">FETCH DSEARCH04</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine"> PAD/U</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine"> NEW</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">FETCH DSEARCH05</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine"> PAD/U</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine"> NEW</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">GDS</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">When you run this MACro, the program will do the following:</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">1. &nbsp;Open the named file.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">2. &nbsp;Refresh the PAD display, showing that lens along with whatever image analysis display you currently have requested.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">3. &nbsp;Wait until you press the &lt;Enter&gt; key. &nbsp;This is the function of the NEW command, which waits for new input. &nbsp;When you press that key, it continues with the next case.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">4. &nbsp;When all lenses have been displayed, the MACro loops to the top (because of the GDS command) and starts over. &nbsp;This lets you cycle through all cases very quickly and select the one you want to work on.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">When you see the one you want, just press the &lt;Esc&gt; key and the MACro will terminate, leaving you with that lens. &nbsp;You can also just click the Run button on the editor, to immediately start optimizing that case.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">So it’s rather easy: type </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">EM DSS</span><span class="f_mine"> and press the &lt;Enter&gt; key repeatedly until you see the version you like, and then click the Run button. &nbsp;Lens design was never so easy!</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">Since DSEARCH can take a while to run, we recommend multicore operation, as mentioned above. &nbsp;If you want to abort the run, there are two options.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">1. &nbsp;Click the STOP button on the progress bar. &nbsp;This stops all cores as soon as practical, and concludes with the statistics of those cases that have run so far.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">2. &nbsp;Click the Stop Process button on the top toolbar. &nbsp;This terminates the run immediately, sending you to the command prompt. &nbsp;In this case, no results from the program are shown.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
