<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">In recent years there has been considerable interest in programs that will provide more than merely a table of sensitivities or their inverse as an aid to computing tolerances for a lens (1,2).</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">Central to the success of these programs are two assumptions which must be reasonably valid: the first is that the change of quality of a lens may be described over a useful range by the first and second derivatives of the quality with respect to each variable, and the second is that certain statistical approximations are valid for the lens.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">The first has been discussed in </span><span class="f_mine" style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="um122.htm" class="topiclink">section 12.2</a></span><span class="f_mine">; for most lenses the two derivatives are reasonably adequate provided that they are calculated exactly, at a typical tolerance level, rather than algebraically with the nominal design. &nbsp;This is the case with </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">BTOL</span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">The second assumption is a consequence of the law of large numbers, which states that the sum of a large number of independent, randomly distributed variables (or functions of them) is given by a bell-shaped probability curve, called the Gaussian, or normal probability density function. &nbsp;This curve may be described completely by its mean value, </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial'; font-weight: bold;">&mu;</span><span class="f_mine"> and its variance, </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial'; font-weight: bold;">&sigma;</span><span class="f_mine">. &nbsp;Under the proper conditions these quantities may be calculated from the corresponding mean and variance of each of the independent functions and are independent of the particular probability distribution of the latter.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">This says that if we know the mean value, </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial'; font-weight: bold;">&mu;</span><span class="f_mine">, and the standard deviation, </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial'; font-weight: bold;">&sigma;</span><span class="f_mine">, of each of the random variables (lens parameters, in our case), we can predict the probability of the quality descriptor exceeding a threshold value.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">In order for the law of large numbers to be valid, the number need not be particularly large: numerical evaluation indicates that with as few as six or eight variables the departure of the distribution from Gaussian is negligible. &nbsp;Three other conditions that must be satisfied are called </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-style: italic;">form invariance</span><span class="f_mine">, </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-style: italic;">independence</span><span class="f_mine">, and </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-style: italic;">lack of dominance</span><span class="f_mine">. These require that the shape of the probability distribution of each variable not be a function of the magnitude of the tolerance, that an error in one variable not affect the errors in others, and that many variables contribute more or less equally to the performance degradation.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">In most lenses these conditions are adequately satisfied, particularly if the variables are properly defined. &nbsp;For example, if a thickness error causes an airspace error of the opposite sign somewhere else, they are not independent – but the variable may be redefined as the shift of a surface rather than a simple thickness variation, and in this case the requirement of independence is again satisfied.  </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">BTOL</span><span class="f_mine"> accommodates this requirement with the </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="um1211.htm#bgroup" class="topiclink">GROUP</a></span><span class="f_mine"> and </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="um1211.htm#bthc" class="topiclink">THC</a></span><span class="f_mine"> options.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">Given that the above assumptions are sufficiently valid, the effect of all of the variables on the lens quality may be determined as follows:</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">If the quality descriptor is denoted by Q, and each variable by Xj then the dependence of Q on the Xj can be written as</span></p>

<p class="p_mine"><img src="um12f7.png" width="236" height="91" alt="um12f7" style="width:236px;height:91px;border:none"></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">depending on whether Q is a linear or non-linear function of the X.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">We desire to know the mean and variance of the change of Q as a result of all of the errors in the X. &nbsp;Using the expectation operator on Q, it can be shown that for the linear case the mean value of </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial';">&Delta;</span><span class="f_mine">Q is given by</span></p>

<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">and the variance by</span></p>

<p class="p_mine"><img src="um12f9.png" width="147" height="41" alt="um12f9" style="width:147px;height:41px;border:none"></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">where </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial'; font-weight: bold;">&mu;</span><span class="f_mine">j is the mean value of the Xj and </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial'; font-weight: bold;">&sigma;</span><span class="f_mine">j is the standard deviation.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">For the non-linear case these quantities are</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><img src="um12f10.png" width="286" height="101" alt="um12f10" style="width:286px;height:101px;border:none"></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">These equations become somewhat simplified if we make the assumption that the mean value of each variable change is zero. &nbsp;This is no great loss of generality since by properly defining what we mean by the probability distribution of each variable this can always be made true. &nbsp;This subject is discussed more fully below.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">In the linear case, such as when tolerancing the boundary conditions BORE, MAG, and DIS, the result is that the mean value of the change in these quanfities is always zero, and the standard deviation, which is just the root of the variance, is the amount of degradation that will be exceeded by 15.9 percent of the cases. &nbsp;The two-sigma error will be exceeded by only 2.3 percent of all cases.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">For the image quality descriptors, which are nonlinear with respect to the variables, the result is that the mean value of the change of Q is not necessarily zero.  </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">BTOL</span><span class="f_mine"> sums the expected mean and the multiple deviation of </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial'; font-weight: bold;">&Delta;</span><span class="f_mine">Q, and uses this value as the quantity whose magnitude is not to exceed the desired tolerance. &nbsp;The “multiple deviation” here is the second word on the </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-weight: bold;">BTOL</span><span class="f_mine"> line, giving the confidence level as one sigma, two sigma, etc., or the equivalent quantity derived from the percentage criterion, if that is input.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">From these results we see that the only parameter of interest to BTOL, for preparing the budget, is the standard deviation </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial'; font-weight: bold;">&sigma;</span><span class="f_mine"> of each of the variables. &nbsp;The budget is prepared in such a way that a required value of </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial'; font-weight: bold;">&sigma;</span><span class="f_mine"> is obtained for all quantities to be toleranced. &nbsp;In order to relate this to an actual shop tolerance, however, it is necessary to know something about the statistics that apply to the particular variable. &nbsp;In other words, we must know what tolerance to specify in order to guarantee that the variable will have the required variance.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">There are three kinds of statistics that are of interest in this regard. &nbsp;The first is the case when the variable may be described by a single number, such as radii, thicknesses, indices, etc. &nbsp;This is a one-dimensional problem and the only issue is the relative probability of the variable having a particular value within its tolerance range. &nbsp;In some cases we would expect that the variable would be equally likely to appear anywhere in the range, and in others it may be more often near the center or the ends. &nbsp;To resolve such differences requires detailed records of how well a particular optical shop meets the tolerance requirements on the lenses that it has processed. &nbsp;Fortunately, for our purposes this is not very important.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">It is easily shown that the standard deviation of a variable with a uniform probability distribution within a range of plus or minus E is equal to E / (square root of 3). &nbsp;For such a variable the proper tolerance is therefore </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial'; font-weight: bold;">&sigma;</span><span class="f_mine"> * 1.732 where </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial'; font-weight: bold;">&sigma;</span><span class="f_mine"> is the desired multiple deviation value derived from the budget calculation. &nbsp;If a variable is always found at one end of its range or the other, the proper value of E would be </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-style: italic;">equal</span><span class="f_mine"> to </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial'; font-weight: bold;">&sigma;</span><span class="f_mine">. &nbsp;The difference between these two cases is less than a factor of two and you can easily convert from one to the other if you know the details of the distribution of a particular variable. &nbsp;For example, BTOL assumes a uniform distribution for the one-dimensional variables and the printed tolerance is therefore </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial'; font-weight: bold;">&sigma;</span><span class="f_mine"> * 1.732 To convert this to the other distribution merely divide by 1.732.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">A second kind of distribution is two-dimensional, as in the case of element decenters; here the center of the lens may be displaced in both X and Y</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">In general the effects of, say, a Y decenter will be somewhat different than those of an X decenter, when one evaluates only images in the meridional plane. &nbsp;Let us look first at decenters that are confined to a narrow segment of all possible decenters, centered on the Y axis, to determine the expected mean and variance within that region. &nbsp;Consider the distribution shown below.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><img src="um12f11.png" width="327" height="200" alt="um12f11" style="width:327px;height:200px;border:none"></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">Here we see that the probability of a particular decenter being a certain distance from the zero point is greater than in the case of the uniform distribution, discussed above, because there are more possible decenter positions near the periphery of the circle than near the center. &nbsp;For the set of decenters in the above figure it may be shown that the mean value is zero and the standard deviation is just E / 1.414.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">But this considers only decenters near the Y axis. &nbsp;Ideally, the effects of X decenters should be evaluated and subject to the same statistics as the Y decenters, but to do so would increase the computation costs by nearly 50% (since tilts should be treated as well). &nbsp;Instead, let us consider two possibilities: the first is that X decenters are equally serious sources of degradation of images in the meridional plane, and the second is that they are not at all serious, and only affect images in the X-Z plane. &nbsp;In actual practice the effects are usually in between these two extreme cases, so this analysis will bound the problem.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">In the first case, where decenters in any direction are equally serious sources of quality degradation, the problem essentially has become one dimensional, as in the uniform case, except that the statistics involve the root of two instead of three. In the second case, if we integrate over all possible angular orientations of the distribution pictured above, the standard deviation of the decenter turns out to be </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial'; font-weight: bold;">&sigma;</span><span class="f_mine"> = E / 2.0.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">The point of all of this is to show that the tolerances are not particularly sensitive to the details of the probability distributions for each of the lens variables. &nbsp;In order to be conservative, BTOL multiplies the sigma value by the root of three for one-dimensional variables and by the root of two for decenters.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">The cases of wedge, element tilt, and irregularity are similar to that of decenter, except that the one-sigma probability of the error is not increased over the linear case by virtue of a circular distribution. &nbsp;That is, the error itself has a uniform distribution and only its orientation is circular. &nbsp;Again, to minimize computation costs, BTOL assumes that the error is equally serious in all orientations, and utilizes a scaling factor equal to the root of three.</span></p>
