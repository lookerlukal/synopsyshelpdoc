<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">The paragraphs below describe the significance and interpretation of the SYNOPSYS BTOL budget. &nbsp;A copy of this section in PDF format will be found in the C:/SYNOPSYS directory, and it should be sent to the vendor whenever the user places an order for lenses. &nbsp;Perhaps this will lead to improved communication between the parties and more faithful adherence to the numbers on the print.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine" style="text-align: center;"><span class="f_mine" style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold;">Lens Tolerancing Today</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">Calculating the tolerances on lenses has long been an imprecise exercise of judgment on the part of the designer, and many optical shops view the numbers on the print as nothing more than a guess. &nbsp;Some substitute their standard shop tolerances, while others seem to ignore tolerances altogether, feeling that they are without rational basis.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">This is not true – but since many shop personnel do not understand how the science of lens tolerancing has matured, we provide here a short outline of some of the statistical considerations that produce a modern lens tolerance budget. &nbsp;We hope that this will lead to a better understanding of and more careful adherence to the tolerances on the print.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">The drawings contain, for every parameter whose value strongly affects the performance of the final lens system, a tolerance value. &nbsp;Whereas in the past those numbers often represented someone’s standard procedure or a fixed fraction of the value in question, today we have a rigorous statistical procedure that will </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-style: italic;">guarantee</span><span class="f_mine"> that the system will work as planned, provided that the tolerances are absolutely adhered to. &nbsp;The tool in question is the BTOL feature of the SYNOPSYS lens design program, which is arguably the most powerful lens tolerancing program in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">This software calculates how every design parameter affects each of a variety of quality descriptors, and finds the first and second derivatives of that quality with respect to the parameters. &nbsp;Then the rules of statistics tell us that, if we know the mean value and standard deviation of each parameter, we also know the mean value and standard deviation of each of the quality descriptors. &nbsp;The procedure is rigorous under certain conditions, and the output from the program is a table giving all of the tolerances. &nbsp;Thus, we know, for example, that if the lens is built to that table, then the Strehl ratio everywhere in the field will be higher than, say, 0.7, to a confidence level of 2, which means that we could confidently predict that of a large batch of lenses, 97.7% will in fact have a larger Strehl ratio. &nbsp;Gone is the guesswork behind a lens tolerance budget.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">But we mentioned “certain conditions.” &nbsp;Here is where the vendor can help to meet the error budget – or derail the whole procedure. &nbsp;For the budget to be valid, the following must be true:</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">1. &nbsp;The mean value of each parameter must be at the design value.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">2. &nbsp;The parameter must be equally likely to be found anywhere within its error bracket. </span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">Let us look at how some shops deviate from these statistical assumptions. &nbsp;First, consider the case where a testplate was poorly measured. &nbsp;The print calls out a radius, with a tolerance, and when the testplate is measured more carefully it is found to be different from the assumed value – but the error is still within the tolerance budget. &nbsp;Do you make the lens to that testplate? &nbsp;Most shops would say yes, because the radius is within tolerance. &nbsp;But clearly, this violates item 1 above: the mean value will be the </span><span class="f_mine" style="font-style: italic;">remeasured</span><span class="f_mine"> value, not the design value.</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_mine"><span class="f_mine">I am astonished by how many shops keep a poorly measured testplate list. &nbsp;To use such a list, one must ask for each testplate to be remeasured, then reoptimize the lens to the new values, if possible. &nbsp;If this does not work, then new testplates may be needed and the whole procedure repeated. &nbsp;This drives up design costs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Yet another issue involves element thicknesses. &nbsp;Many shops aim for the high end of the tolerance budget, so that if reworking the part is required the thickness is less likely to go under. &nbsp;This of course also violates the statistics. &nbsp;Or, if many elements must be reworked, all of them could wind up at the low end of the range. &nbsp;Here is an example: &nbsp;The drawing below shows the distribution function for a lens where the thicknesses errors are uniformly distributed. &nbsp;The desired Strehl Ratio is achieved quite well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="mcud.png" width="651" height="378" alt="MCUD" style="width:651px;height:378px;border:none"></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Statistical distribution function with uniform error statistics</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Compare that to the curves in the next picture; in this case, all thicknesses were at the high end of their range, and the yield is significantly poorer – even though, on paper, all tolerances were met.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="mchd.png" width="675" height="418" alt="MCHD" style="width:675px;height:418px;border:none"></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Statistical distribution function when thicknesses are at the high end of the tolerance range</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In this case, one could better obtain the desired results by recognizing that the thicknesses conform to different statistics. &nbsp;One wants the </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic;">standard deviation</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> of the thickness to be the same as with the uniform distribution, and this will occur if one divides the thickness tolerances by the square root of three for this case. &nbsp;Then the expected value of the thickness error will be the same as for the uniform distribution, and the expected yield will again be achieved. &nbsp;It is a safe bet that few shops understand this kind of subtlety.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Success in optics requires close collaboration with the vendor, who must understand the significance of the issues presented here. &nbsp;If the designer can connect with the shop to this degree, there will be fewer instances of lenses that do not work as they should. &nbsp;It would be helpful if designers would spell out these considerations when approaching a vendor, thereby insuring that ignorance would no longer be an excuse for the failure of a project, as it sometimes has in the past.</span></p>
